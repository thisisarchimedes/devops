# DevOps

This repo intends to be cloned with all other production repo. It provides a set of tools to monitor DevOps metrics we care about (like time it takes for a PR test to complete). This is always a work in progress, and we add and remove metrics as we go

# Expected log formation

Here is an example of a log item
```json

    info.action:"PR Test"
    info.repo:"thisisarchimedes/SustainableLeverage"
    info.test_pass:"true"
    info.test_time_seconds:"40"
    message:"DevOps Event: thisisarchimedes/SustainableLeverage"
    newrelic.logPattern:"nr.DID_NOT_MATCH"
    newrelic.source:"api.logs"
